What is Adventure Time DevOps
-----------------------------

The primary focus of this blog is dedicated to sharing knowledge on topics
dear and near to my heart: **Desigining and Automating DevOps workflow** and
writing **System level applications and tools**.

Being a half-and-half social retard like I am, posts here and there are related
to trying to understand interactions and the meaning behind it, or simply
expressing foolish contempt, and lonesome.

To me, the blog is a journal documenting my work, research, and my journey in
life as a self-developing professional.  If something I wrote here appears
wrong to you, or you have an alternative approach to the problem, please feel
free to shoot me a message on *twitter* and *email*.

Side Note
---------

People these days are prone to anger and rage to the point where discussion
becomes frustrating and hurtful.  One has to accept that life does not take
pity on oneself, and most things will not go in the way one hope it would, it
does not help one in any way to grief everyone else. In the end, time you spent
ranting and lamenting is time you did not choose to spend on yourself, and a
bad investment in life.
